== Introduction

Welcome to Polonium!

Polonium is a wrapper for Selenium that lets your write cleaner Selenium tests
in ruby, and run them with a simple set of rake tasks.

== Installation
Polonium depends on the Selenium gem. To install this dependency, run:
  sudo gem install Selenium

The current version of this plugin can be found at: http://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/polonium/trunk

You may install the plugin with the following command:

  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/polonium/trunk

You may also use Polonium as a gem:

  sudo gem install polonium

== Getting Started
The polonium plugin rake tasks assumes you have a test/selenium directory with a selenium_suite.rb file in
it.  To get started, copy examples/selenium_suite.rb, examples/selenium_helper.rb, and examples/example_test.rb
into your test/selenium directory.

To start the selenium server, run the command:
  selenium
The selenium command was installed with the Selenium Gem.

You can run Polonium tests using rspec or test/unit through the rake tasks.
  rake selenium:test
  # or
  rake selenium:spec

[TODO: this doesn't seem to work on a vanilla project that is using Polonium as a gem & the code in
the examples directory; @selenium_driver is nil.  Is there an extra step necessary to get this working?]

You can also run individual tests straight ruby:

ruby test/selenium/any_selenium_test.rb

== Future Enhancements

There are a few things we'd like to improve, but we wanted to get this out now.  Check the tracker in the pivotal.rb RubyForge project for details.

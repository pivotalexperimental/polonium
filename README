== Introduction

Welcome to Polonium!

This plugin is designed to let you use Polonium to write Selenium tests in Ruby, using a simple series of
Rake tasks.

== Installation
Polonium depends on the Selenium gem. To install this dependency, run:
  sudo gem install Selenium

The current version of this plugin can be found at: http://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/polonium/trunk

You may install the plugin with the following command:

  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/polonium/trunk

== Usage
The polonium plugin assumes you have a test/selenium directory with a selenium_suite.rb file in
it.  A sample selenium_suite.rb and selenium_helper.rb can be copied into your test/selenium directory.

To start the selenium server, run the command:
  selenium
The selenium command was installed with the Selenium Gem.

You can run Poloium tests using rspec or test/unit through the rake tasks.
  rake selenium:test
  # or
  rake selenium:spec

== Future Enhancements

There are a few things we'd like to improve, but we wanted to get this out now.  Check the tracker in the pivotal.rb RubyForge project for details.

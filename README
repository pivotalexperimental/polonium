== Introduction

Welcome to Selenium RC Fu!

This plugin is designed to let you use Selenium RC to write Selenium tests in Ruby, using a simple series of
Rake tasks.

== Installation

The current version of this plugin can be found at: http://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/seleniumrc_fu/trunk

You may install the plugin with the following command:

  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/pivotalrb/seleniumrc_fu/trunk

== Usage
The seleniumrc_fu plugin assumes you have a test/selenium directory with a selenium_suite.rb file in
it.  A sample selenium_suite.rb and selenium_helper.rb can be copied into your test/selenium directory.

You'll get the following tasks:
  - selenium:test - starts a Selenium RC server, runs selenium tests, and shuts the server down
     when they're done

and lower level tasks as well:
  - selenium:server starts up a Selenium RC server
  - selenium:test_with_server_started  runs Selenium tests off of an existing server

== Future Enhancements

There are a few things we'd like to improve, but we wanted to get this out now.  Check the tracker in the pivotal.rb RubyForge project for details.
